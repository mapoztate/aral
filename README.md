#### Think Quizlet, but open source.
While open source learning alternatives already exist (ie: Anki), the program lacks a lot of features that Quizlet Plus used to offer for free, and it's not hosted on the web. The name comes from the Tagalog word "study", but honestly, someone can probably think of a better name than I can.

Key features:
* Flashcards
* Fill-in-the-blank test feature
* Matching cards

Nice-to-haves: 
* Google Calendar API to send notifcations for Pomodoros or when to study sets?

For now, this is just a proof of concept for stacks used, since I don't really have the back-end experience or time to build this:
* React & Redux (the whole point is to build as a PWA)
* Firebase for authentication
* Host on Heroku
